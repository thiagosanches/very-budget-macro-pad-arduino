# very-budget-macro-pad-arduino
This project uses an Arduino Pro Micro and its feature as a HID (Human Interface Device), to make a simple macro pad. Initially, I'm using to control the volume, skip and play/pause the music (tested on Windows and Linux). It works as the media keys that we have on some keyboards model.

## 3d model
As a suggestion you can use [this](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/6qNC2uKGQGF-mini-macro-pad-arduino-pro-micro-rotary-encoder) model to fit the board and its components.

## The code.
You can deploy this code into your Arduino Pro Micro board through Arduino IDE.
